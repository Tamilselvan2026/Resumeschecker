Developed a machine learning-based resume evaluation tool that automatically classifies resumes as "Good" or "Bad" based on their content. The system utilizes supervised learning techniques with scikit-learn, including text vectorization using CountVectorizer and a Logistic Regression classifier. Trained on labeled resume data, the model learns to assess resume quality efficiently, providing instant feedback to users. This project demonstrates core AI and NLP concepts such as natural language processing (NLP), feature extraction, and predictive modeling.
