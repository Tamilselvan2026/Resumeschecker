The Resume Checker Web App is a full-stack platform built to assist job seekers in crafting and improving their resumes through AI-powered analysis and personalized feedback. This application allows users to securely sign up or log in, upload their resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX, JPG), and receive automated suggestions for grammatical corrections, logical structure, and formatting improvements. Once logged in, users are taken to a dynamic dashboard that includes multiple career-enhancing tools such as a resume builder with templates, a resume checker powered by natural language processing (NLP), a job search strategy generator based on resume data, and a training program recommender tailored to the userâ€™s skills and goals. The dashboard also includes visual analytics, providing users with insights into their activity and progress through interactive charts and summaries. The frontend of the application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is powered by Python with Flask. User authentication is handled via SQLite, and user data, including resume content, is stored in MongoDB. The app also integrates Streamlit to provide a clean, interactive UI for resume feedback and recommendations. This project showcases the integration of frontend and backend technologies, database management, file handling, and AI-powered text analysis, making it an ideal solution for students, professionals, and anyone looking to optimize their resume for job applications.
